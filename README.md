Input example:

SHE: Could you take out the trash? It's already full.
HE: Sure, I'll do it right now.
SHE: Not "right now," you said that yesterday, and it's still here.
HE: Okay, I'll take it out immediately.
SHE: And after that, check the shopping list. We're missing some things.
HE: I'll take a look.
SHE: Not just look, go and buy them. Milk, bread, eggs.
HE: Alright, I'll go to the store.
SHE: And please, this time, get the right milk, not the low-fat one.
HE: Got it, whole milk.
SHE: One more thing – did you fix the leaking faucet in the bathroom?
HE: Not yet, but it's on my list.
SHE: It's been on your list for a week. Can you fix it today?
HE: Okay, I'll check it after dinner.
SHE: After dinner, you won’t feel like it. Do it now.
HE: Fine, I’ll do it now.
SHE: Thank you. And when you're done, could you also water the plants?
