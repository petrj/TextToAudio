Input example:

SHE: Could you take out the trash? It's already full.

HE: Sure, I'll do it right now.

SHE: Not "right now," you said that yesterday, and it's still here.

HE: Okay, I'll take it out immediately.

SHE: And after that, check the shopping list. We're missing some things.

HE: I'll take a look.

SHE: Not just look, go and buy them. Milk, bread, eggs.

HE: Alright, I'll go to the store.

SHE: And please, this time, get the right milk, not the low-fat one.

HE: Got it, whole milk.

SHE: One more thing – did you fix the leaking faucet in the bathroom?

HE: Not yet, but it's on my list.

SHE: It's been on your list for a week. Can you fix it today?

HE: Okay, I'll check it after dinner.

SHE: After dinner, you won’t feel like it. Do it now.

HE: Fine, I’ll do it now.

SHE: Thank you. And when you're done, could you also water the plants?
